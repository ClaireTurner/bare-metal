# What if my bare metal server has out of date firmware?



Like software updates, it is important to keep firmware updated to ensure optimal device compatibility and stability. If a {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} firmware is out of date, a firmware update may be initiated during the [OS Reload](../infrastructure/software/vsi_reload_os.html) process within the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com).

The firmware may also be updated by selecting the bare metal server from the device list and selecting **Update Firmware** from the action menu drop down.
