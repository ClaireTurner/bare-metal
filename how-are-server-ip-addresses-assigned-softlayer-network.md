# Assigning server IP addresses

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} provisions servers with a single Primary IP Address that is associated to the device. Each server is allocated one Primary IP. All other IP addresses that are associated with a server must be from a secondary subnet, which you can purchase at any time through the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com) or on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) website. For more information on available options and pricing for addresses, see [Networking services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/network).
