# Disk configuration in new orders

The Disk Configuration tool that is available when you order a new device allows for easy customization when you configure drives on your new device. Configuration occurs during the provisioning process and is based on selections that are made in the Disk Controller section of the order form. The Disk Configuration tool has the following features:

* Add/edit one or more disks at a time by clicking the disk and by using the Assign Disks menu option.
* Create Primary Disk Partitions with system-specific partition templates.
* Create [JBOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBOD#JBOD), [RAID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID), or [Global Hot Spare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spare) advanced storage groups and partitions with custom group types and size.
* Use custom partition templates that are associated with your account when you order a new device through the Customer Portal.

This feature works with any server that can be provisioned, including Big Data devices. If you order a device from a Flex Image, the partition template that is included in the image is provisioned with the device. A new partition template cannot be selected while you order a device from a Flex Image. For more information on hard drive options and pricing, open up a live chat with the Sales Team.
