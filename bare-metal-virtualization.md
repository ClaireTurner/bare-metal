# Virtualization
{: #bm-virtualization}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} Virtualization to run multiple virtual machines in a single dedicated environment. Virtual
machines that run on an {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network can integrate with other physical and virtual devices that are on the
network and are managed through both the Customer Portal and API. For more information, see
[Getting started with Virtualization](/docs/infrastructure/virtualization?topic=Virtualization-getting-started-tutorial).
