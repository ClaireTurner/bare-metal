# Will SoftLayer regularly backup my bare metal servers?

We provide a variety of scalable [backup and storage solutions](https://www.softlayer.com/cloud-storage) to meet your backup requirements. However, we do not complete backups of customer devices. All scheduled and one-time backups on customer devices must be initiated and completed by a user on the account.
