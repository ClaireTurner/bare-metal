# SSL certificates
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application that is involved in the conversation. This encryption is accomplished through a public key/private key system that uses an SSL certificate.
{:shortdesc}

The SSL certificate contains the serverâ€™s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a host name for which the certificate is valid and a signature from the Certification Authority that issued it. With this information and some protocol information that is exchanged during the beginning of a session, the client can be reasonably certain that the server is the one to which it is intending to talk.

For more information about SSL certificates, see [Getting started with SSL certificates](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates/index.html).
