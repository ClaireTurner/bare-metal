# POWER8 in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - FAQ

|1.|Offering Details||
|---|---|---|
|1.1|What's happening when?|<ul><li>SoftLayer has expanded their offerings to include POWER8-based bare metal systems.  These systems are build with IBM's new POWER8 processor and a OpenPOWER-based platform tuned specifically for cloud-based deployements of data, cognitive, and web workloads on Linux.</li><li>Virtual Machines as a Service are being beta tested and expected to be offered in the near future.</li></ul>|
|1.2|What is OpenPOWER and why do I care?|<ul><li>OpenPOWER-based servers are a new breed of open, powerful, and customizable systems built on the POWER8 acrchitecture; the only processor designed from the ground up for data intensive workloads.</li><li>The OpenPOWER Foundation (OPF) started small in August 2013, as a consortium of just five companies with a big idea: Enable new approaches to technology and innovation by making POWER hardware and software available to open development, and build an industry-wide alliance to expand the ecosystem of innovators on the platform.  OPF has grown to more than 190 participants in it's short existence.  This rapid growth reflects the excitement across the industry about this effor to "re-imagine the datacenter".</li><li>The OpenPOWER platform will bring the capabilities of POWER8 and innovations resulting from open collaboration among OpenPOWER to the SoftLayer public cloud.</li></ul>|
|1.3|What are the advantages of the POWER8 platform in SoftLayer?|<ul><li>POWER8 brings a unique alternative to traditional cloud platforms  with architecture optimized for data workloads.  Performance testing shows an average of 2x better performance compared to comparable x86 systems for data workloads.  Benchmarking tests have shown POWER8 in SoftLayer can deliver:<ul><li>1.76x more queries per hour at 20% lower costs per query for DB2 with BLU.</li><li>DB2 with BLU Acceleration on POWER8 in the cloud delivers cognitive insights 43% faster and 65% more insights in the same amount of time.</li><li>64% better performance for Spark Machine Learning used in data classification and predictive analytics.</li><li>66% faster for Spark SQL processing used widely in Big Data clusters.</li><li>Complete social connections and product recommendations 83% faster based on Spark graph workloads.</li></ul></li></ul>|
|1.4|What are the details of the offering?|<ul><li>The first phase of POWER8 systems are available for monthly rental and include 4 fixed configurations of Bare Metal deployments: small, medium, large, and large with SSDs, with Ubuntu OS installed.</li><li>The offerings include standard SoftLayer API support and most of the adjunct service offerings such as storage, networking, and firewall.</li><li>POWER8 systems are initially in the DAL09 datacenter, and will expand to other geographies later in 2016.</li></ul>|

|1.5|What does the naming signify?|The new POWER8 naming format is C812L where:<ul><li>"C" = Cloud</li><li>"8" = POWER8</li><li>"1" = # of cores</li><li>"2" = 2U</li><li>"L"= Linux</li></ul>|
|1.6|What operating systems are supported.  Can I run AIX or IBM i?|<ul><li>SoftLayer will offer the Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS operating system initially, and will be adding other Linux distributions later.</li><li>These systems are not capable of runnign AIX or IBM i.  AIX as a Service is available from IBM's Cloud managed Services and hosted IBM i is available through many of our global Business Partners.</li></ul>|
||Can I rent a system with the AIX or IBM i operating system?|<ul<li>IBM will continue to offer AIX in the cloud through IBM's Cloud Managed Services, and other partners.  IBM i-based cloud services are also available thorugh many of our MSP partners.</li></ul>|
|**2.**|**Go To Market**||
|2.1|Who would benefit from using POWER8?|<ul><li>The initial suite of POWER8 offerings in SoftLayer are well suited for existing Power customers who want to extend the value of their existing systems for hybrid cloud solutions.</li><li>Optimized for data workloads, these systems can be easily leveraged for Development/Test in the cloud, rapid POCs to prove out performance advantages of Power, or to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-port-linux-on-x86-application/">easily port applications</a> to Power or the <a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/wps/servlet/ContentHandler/stg_com_sys_power-development-platform">Power Developer Cloud</a> and the <a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/lopdiags/sdklop.html">SDK for Linux on Power</a>.</li><li>POWER8 in the SoftLayer cloud can also be used to support integrated applications leveraging both private and public cloud resources.</li><li>POWER8 bare metal systems can also be an excellent hosting platform for new applications such as Genomics, financial, or cognitive services.</li></ul>|
|2.2|What are the most common use cases?|<ul><li>Data and analytics intensive workloads that run on the Ubuntu OS such as DB2 with BLU, Cognos, or WebSphere.</li><li>Open-source applications such as Apache Spark, MariaDB, and LAMP-enabled applications such as e-commerce or Content Management Systems.</li><li>Dev/Test, porting, and tuning for Linux on Power workloads.</li><li>Proof of Concepts for competitive UNIX workloads and other application stacks.</li></ul>|
|2.3|What are the benefits to our customers?|<ul><li>The POWER8 is the only processor designed for data and is at the head of IBM's Power Systems line of servers. {{site.data.keywords_baremetal_short}} are ideal for businesses that want to run demanding, data intensive and cognitive workloads in the cloud.</li><li>For data and analytics workloads, POWER8's increased threads, memory bandwidth, and speed can deliver higher throughput and performance than comparable x86-based systems.</li></ul>|
|2.4|How are POWER8 {{site.data.keywords_baremetal_short}} ordered?|<ul><li>POWER8 Bare Metal as a Service will be available and orderable from the catalog like any other SoftLayer service.</li><li>POWER8 Bare Metal is also available as a standard IBM Cloud offering that can be written into any IBM Cloud contract by IBM and BP sellers.</li></ul>|
