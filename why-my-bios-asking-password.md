# Why is my BIOS asking for a password?

Currently we do not provide customer's with direct access to their BIOS. This is for a various number of reasons, but that is not to say you cannot make changes to the BIOS. If you need anything modified in the BIOS, including boot order, please create a ticket under Support > Add Ticket and request the specific changes you need.

\*\*NOTE\*\* This will require a reboot of your server to do, so please be ready to approve a reboot and/or provide a time frame for when you would like the change made
