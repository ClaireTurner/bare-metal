# Reserved bare metal servers
{: #about-reserved-bare-metal-servers}

{{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} reserved instances offering is a great option if you want guaranteed resources for future deployments and cost savings. You choose between either a 1-year or a 3-year contract. You are guaranteed reserved instances within the POD and data center of your choice for the life of the contract term.

Reserved bare metal server instances offer many conveniences, including the following advantages:

* **Guaranteed availability**

    When you reserve capacity, this capacity is guaranteed for the life of your contract term.

* **Global availability**

    The reserved bare metal server offering is available in data centers across the globe.

* **Reliable provisioning**

   You can provision and reclaim bare metal server instances at any time.

* **Cost savings**

    Choosing either a 1-year or a 3-year contract term allows for consistent monthly payments and reduced costs compared to hourly or monthly bare metal server billing cycles.

* **Cloud strategy** 

    Improve you budgeting and forecasting with a consistent  monthly payment.

## Limitations

Consider the following limitations before you reserve capacity and provision reserved bare metal server instances:

* Reserved bare metal server instances can use only SAN-backed storage (balanced, memory, compute).
* You can't upgrade or downgrade your instances.
* Reserved capacity cannot be canceled; however, you can reclaim bare metal server instances in that capacity.

## Notifications

An email notification is sent one month before the end of the term on your reserved bare metal server capacity.
