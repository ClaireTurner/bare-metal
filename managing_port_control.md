# Managing port control for a device

Each device associated with an account has two network ports that receive incoming traffic â€“ one for public network traffic and one for private network traffic. These ports may be enabled or disabled at any time to control the network traffic that a device receives. Complete the following steps to update the port control settings for a device.

## Manage the port control for a device

1. Access the Device List and select the device to update.  
2. Click the **Actions** drop down list for the device.
3. Select **Port Control**.
4. Update the *Public Network* and/or *Private Network* drop down boxes by completing one of the following actions:
   * Select desired speed to enable network access.
   * Select Disconnected to disable network access.
5. Click the Update button.
6. Click the Close button to close the window.

## Next Steps

If **Disabled** has been selected, network access for the disabled port will cease for the device interface. If **Enabled** is selected, network access will be available for the enabled port. Port control will remain in the selected setting until manually changed.
